I am a Linguistics PhD student at the University of Chicago, morpho-syntactician in the making, very amateur go player, and an enthusiastic dabbler of handcrafts.

## Linguist's Statement
I am interested in researching the systematic grammatical underpinnings of cross-linguistic variation, specifically with regards to how Syntax and its interfaces with morphological, phonological, and semantic systems facilitate and constrain the range of cross-linguistic variety in phenomena such as affixation and cliticization mechanisms, the availability of different types of ellipsis, the realization of agreement, and linearization of syntactic structures.

## Linguistic Research Interests 
* Syntax, Morphology, Morphosyntax
* Syntax Interfaces
	* Ellipsis (VP-E, Sluicing, Gapping)
	* Agreement
	* Agglutination
	* Linearization
* Turkic Linguistics
* Experimental Syntax

## Outside Interests
* Tea
* Succulents
	* Favorite Genuses: Crassula, Haworthia, Gasteria
* Wood-fired Pottery
	* Favorite Styles: Shino-yaki, Bucheong wares
* Decorative Knotwork
* Archery
	* Flavor: Olympic Recurve, Thumb-release Horsebow
