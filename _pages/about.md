I am a Linguistics PhD student at the University of Chicago, morpho-syntactician in the making, very amateur go player, and an enthusiastic dabbler of handcrafts.

## Linguist's Statement
I am interested in researching the systematic grammatical underpinnings of cross-linguistic variation, specifically with regards to how syntax and its interfaces with morphological, phonological, and semantic systems facilitate and constrain the range of cross-linguistic variety in phenomena such as affixation and cliticization mechanisms, the availability of different types of ellipsis, the realization of agreement and concord, and linearization of syntactic structures.

## Linguistic Research Interests 
* Syntax, Morphology, Morphosyntax
* Syntax Interfaces
	* Ellipsis (VP-E, Sluicing, Gapping)
	* Agreement & Concord
	* Suppletion and Allomorphy
	* Agglutination
	* Linearization
* Turkic Linguistics
* Experimental Syntax

## Non-Academic Interests
* Tea
* Succulents & Drought Resistant Plants
	* Favorite Genuses: Crassula, Haworthia, Gasteria, Adenium
* Wood-fired Pottery
	* Favorite Styles: Shino-yaki, Bucheong wares
* Archery
	* Flavor: Olympic Recurve, Thumb-release Asiatic Bows
